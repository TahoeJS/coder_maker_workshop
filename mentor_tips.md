## No Downloads
Since most of the participants are working on borrowed laptop, the workshop is designed to use native tools; i.e. Text edit instead of Sublime, ftp commands instead of Filezilla.  We want the participants to be able to carry on without having a specific computer of their own.  

## Save to Desktop
Participants should save all their work to a folder on the desktop called **tempbug**.  This will minimize the chance of permission issues on Guest logins or participants losing their work on an unfamiliar laptop.

## Famous Women
We're using a theme of famous women for the content and names we're using in the workshop.  This is to promote women in STEM and inspire the participants.  Each tempbug is named for a famous woman and the content on each website should inlude some information about that woman.

## Privacy
We're specifically not asking for last names, email addresses or locations from any workshop participant.  Please use first names only and to personalize introductions, talk about why you like programming or making.

## FTP Instructions
Each coding participant will have a card with credentials for their own personal website.  FTP address, FTP username, FTP password
- Mac use Terminal (search with Spotlight), PC use Command Prompt (Windows key + R, then cmd)
- navigate to tempbug folder on desktop
