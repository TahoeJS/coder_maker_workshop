# Mentor Tips
Thank you for mentoring!  It's awesome :)  We'll have a large variety of experience levels and ages among our participants. [Recommendations for young participants](http://techbridgegirls.org/rolemodelsmatter/tool/giving-girlsfeedback/) You'll be working directly with two participants.  You'll hand out their instructions and materials and coach them through the coding steps.  (Maker coaching will be done directly at the soldering stations.)

The instructions are deliberately incomplete so that each participant can customize their website.  Help participants learn by encouraging them to:
- look up answers on the Internet (make sure they only find safe sites)
- experiment (try their ideas, making it clear it is okay if they don't work)
- guess (give them hints, not the answers)

Coders will spending all three hands-on sessions coding and can do all steps.

Coder/Makers will spend two hands-on sessions coding and one hands-on session making.  They should complete steps without letter suffixes.

Makers will spend all three hands-on sessions making.

## Privacy
We're specifically not asking for last names, email addresses or locations from any workshop participant.  Please use first names only and to personalize introductions, talk about why you like programming or making.

## Famous Women
We're using a theme of famous women for the content and names we're using in the workshop.  This is to promote women in STEM and inspire the participants.  Each tempbug is named for a famous woman and the content on each website should inlude some information about that woman.

## Save to Desktop
Participants should save all their work to a folder on the desktop called **tempbug**.  This will minimize the chance of permission issues on Guest logins or participants losing their work on an unfamiliar laptop.

## No Downloads
Since most of the participants are working on borrowed laptop, the workshop is designed to use native tools; i.e. Text edit instead of Sublime, ftp commands instead of Filezilla.  We want the participants to be able to carry on without having a specific computer of their own.  

## HTML Document
In order to be able to use native tools to make the index.html document for the website, you'll need to make some configuration changes on both Mac and PC.   Generally,  you'll find it easier to create the document, then edit the file name directly to make sure it is just index.html

### PC
Use Notepad on PC to create the html document.  To run Notepad, type Windows + R, notepad. The default extension will be .txt   To change this, use Windows + E for Windows Explorer, find Tools (XP), Organize (W7) then View (W8) and check the box required to show file extensions.  The find index.txt in Windows Explorer and rename to index.html

### Mac
Use Text Edit on Mac to create the HTML document.  Use spotlight to find Text Edit then configure to allow creation of HTML documents with these [instructions](http://support.apple.com/kb/TA20406)

## FTP Instructions
Each coding participant will have a card with credentials for their own personal website.  FTP address, FTP username, FTP password
- Mac use Terminal (search with Spotlight), PC use Command Prompt (Windows key + R, then cmd)
- navigate to tempbug folder on desktop
- ftp ftp.address.com
- enter ftp username and password
- cd public_html
- put *
- exit
