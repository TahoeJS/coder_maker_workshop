## No Downloads
Since most of the participants are working on borrowed laptop, the workshop is designed to use native tools; i.e. Text edit instead of Sublime, ftp commands instead of Filezilla.  We want the participants to be able to carry on without having a specific computer of their own.  

## Save to Desktop
Participants should save all their work to a folder on the desktop.  This will minimize the chance of permission issues on Guest logins or having participants lose their work on an unfamiliar laptop.
